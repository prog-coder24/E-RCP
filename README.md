**E-Railway Concession Portal** is a web application build to automate the tiresome manual process of railway concession systems in colleges. This web application provides an interface to the students who can put up an online request for the concession form and then fill up all the essential details. On the college administration side, the concerned authority, also through an application interface, can view all the requests for the concession form. The authority then prepares the concession form for every request and selects a confirmation checkbox so that students can get acknowledgement to collect the approved form.
